# Introduction

This tools allows you to quickly analyze captured hex data of TuyaMCU packets. Pasted hex data is split into TuyaMCU packets, analyzed and coloured according to each byte meaning. TuyaMCU variables (dpIDs) are displayed along with their types and values, so you can efficiently analyze devices and add their support to [OpenBeken](https://github.com/openshwprojects/OpenBK7231T_App)

# Compiling

MSVC Community 2017 C# project is included, project is a WinForms app build with NET Framework 2.0

# Contributing

Feel free to add new features and improve the codebase, whole tool was quickly put together so I can work with TuyaMCU in a more efficient way, it was never written with clean code standards in mind.
